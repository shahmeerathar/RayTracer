Trying to self-learn 3D graphics.

This GPU renderer relies on Metal, so it'll only run on a Mac. On other platforms, it'll default to the (slower) CPU renderer.

If on a Mac, ensure that you have Metal-cpp installed on your system and modify the METALPATH variable in the Makefile to point to your local installation.
